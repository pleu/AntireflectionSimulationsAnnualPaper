	abstract = {We report on the fabrication and characterization of polymer-embedded silver (Ag) microgrid structures using a particle-free reactive Ag ink for flexible high-performance transparent conductive electrodes. The Ag microgrids are cured at low temperatures and embedded directly into flexible polyethylene terephthalate (PET) films to create structures needed for high transparency and low sheet resistance. The conductive grids demonstrate 91.8\% transmission and a sheet resistance of 0.88 Ω/sq corresponding to an optical conductivity ratio σdc/σop of nearly 4500 with gridlines of 10 μm width. The microgrids may be fabricated with gridlines down to 3.5 μm width. The fabrication of microgrids from a particle-free reactive ink results in several enhancements compared to microgrids fabricated from particle-based conductive Ag inks. The use of particle-free ink offers about 2.5 times higher conductivity, over 3 times lower surface roughness, and better stability under mechanical adhesion, bending, and folding tests. Our results demonstrate the following: (1) a scalable approach to microgrid manufacturing, (2) microgrids with nearly the best transparent electrode performance properties, and (3) the clear benefit of the paradigm of particle-free conductive inks compared to conventional nanoparticle inks.},

@article{Sharma:21,
	abstract = {The efficiency and performance of solar cells and modules are typically evaluated and reported at normal incidence under peak solar radiation. We present a simple clear-sky model for solar irradiance that can be used to study the angular and annual performance of new photovoltaic materials. Using this model, we study the effect of solar module orientation for fixed-tilt module installations and different types of tracking (seasonal, 1D, and 2D) as a function of latitude. For fixed-tilt modules, the optimum tilt as a fraction of latitude varies from 0.83 at 1 deg to 0.73 at 60 deg. The effect of tilt misorientation for panels at the optimum azimuth is not very strong as the solar irradiance is about 94.5\% of its optimum at $\pm$20 deg mistilt. Both azimuth misorientation and tilt misorientation are studied. Optimized tilts and times of year for tilting are also obtained for modules that are seasonally adjusted twice and three times a year. The annual solar insolation of fixed modules is compared with modules that are seasonally adjusted twice and three times a year, continuously tracked in the north/south direction, continuously tracked in the east/west direction, and continuously tracked in two directions. The use of single-axis tracking in the east/west direction is preferable to north/south tracking and potentially improves overall energy collection by 16.2\% to 31.0\%. Continuous dual-axis tracking enhances overall annual energy collection by 36.0\% to 45.5\%. The model and provision of open source code provides for a way to assess the performance of new materials.},

	abstract = {Eliminating light reflection from the top glass sheet in optoelectronic applications is often desirable across a broad range of wavelengths and large variety of angles. In this paper, we report on a combined simulation and experimental study of single-layer films, nanowire arrays, and nanocone arrays to meet these antireflection (AR) needs. We demonstrate the application of Bayesian learning to the multiobjective optimization of these structures for broadband and broad angle AR and show the superior performance of Bayesian learning to genetic algorithms for optimization. Our simulations indicate that nanocone structures have the best AR performance of these three structures, and we additionally provide physical insight into the AR performance of different structures. Simulations suggest nanocone arrays are able to achieve a solar integrated normal and 65{\textdegree} incidence angle reflection of 0.15\% and 1.25\%, respectively. A simple and scalable maskless reactive ion etching process is used to create nanocone structures, and etched samples demonstrate a solar integrated normal and 65{\textdegree} reflection of 0.4\% and 4.9\%, respectively, at the front interface.},

We Demonstrate That Dielectric Nanospheres Can Enhance the Absorption in C-Si Thin Films by Coupling Incident Light to Transverse Electric (TE) Waveguide Modes in the C-Si Thin Film. While Sio2 Nanosphere Arrays May Achieve Enhancements of Less Than 10\% Compared to Ideal Double Pass C-Si Thin Films, Higher Index of Refraction Nanospheres Confine Light More Strongly Such That More Nanosphere Resonances May Couple to Waveguide Modes in the C-Si. Si3N4 Nanospheres May Enhance Ultimate Efficiencies by Over 40\% for Thicknesses ?800nm and Tio2 Nanospheres by Over 50\% for Thicknesses ?700nm Compared to Thin Film Structures With Perfect Anti-Reflection Coatings. this Light Trapping Approach Increases the Absorption in the Photoactive Region Without Introducing Additional Surfaces Or Interfaces That Increase Surface Recombination.},

However, It is Not Known What the Performance Limits of These Structures Are in Terms of Transparency and Sheet Resistance.

Numerical Simulations and Analytical Calculations Are Used to Evaluate the Tradeoffs and Correlations between These Three Figures of Merit. a Strong Correlation is Found between Haze and Transmission, Where Structures With High Transmission Tend to Have Low Haze and Vice Versa. Structures With a Pitch Above 1000 Nm Are Beneficial for Achieving Transmission Over 80\% and Larger Thickness is Favorable in Reducing Sheet Resistance Without Significantly Affecting Transmission. Furthermore, Metal Nanomeshes Are Fabricated to Verify Simulation Results. the Haze May Be Primarily Explained by Fraunhofer Diffraction, But the Spectral Dependence of Haze Requires Analysis With Mie Scattering Theory. the Results Should Apply to All Metal Grid Or Grating-Like Structures. the Fundamental Performance Limits Evaluated Here Are Helpful for Guiding Engineering Design and Research Prioritization.},

	abstract = {Polypropylene (PP) is used in a wide variety of medical components, but is susceptible to bacteria surface colonization and biofilm formation, which lead to infections and inflammations. In this study, we report on the micro-/nanostructuring and surface functionalization of PP substrates through various oxygen and fluorine reactive ion etching (RIE) treatments and their effects on wettability and bacteria adhesion. We found that oxygen treatment creates a hydrophilic surface that reduces bacteria adhesion by 68.7\% compared to the control, but additional nanostructuring reduces the surface's anti-biofouling properties due to increased microscale roughness and air pockets that reduce the effectiveness of the liquid barrier. We demonstrate that a fluorine etch chemistry may be utilized to create lotus leaf-inspired, low surface energy, hierarchical microstructure/nanofibrils in PP. Due to the low surface energy and hierarchical morphology, the surface exhibits lotus-leaf wetting (high contact angle ~155$\,^{\circ}$ and low contact angle hysteresis < 10$\,^{\circ}$) where water droplets easily roll off the surface in contrast to other PP samples. The lotus leaf-inspired hierarchical, fluorinated surfaces exhibit a 99.6\% reduction of E. coli cell adhesion compared to untreated PP. These surfaces demonstrate water contact angle stability over a week in contrast to hydrophilic samples, where the contact angle degrades after just a few days. These new surfaces may help reduce the spread of infections from various plastic medical components without the need for the loading of antibacterial agents that eventually deplete from the surface.},

	abstract = {a Tradeoff between the Carrier Concentration and the Carrier Mobility is An Inherent Problem of Traditional Transparent Conducting Oxide (TCO) Films. in this Study, We Demonstrate That the Electron Concentration of TCO Film Can Be Increased Without Deteriorating the Carrier Mobility by Embedding Ag Nanoparticles (Nps) Into Al-Doped Zno (AZO) Films. An Increment of Ag NP Content Up to 0.7 Vol\% in the AZO Causes the Electron Concentration Rising from 2 × 1019 to 4 × 1020 Cm-3. a Dependence of the Conductivity on Temperature Suggests That the Thermal Activation Energy of this Electron Donation from Ag Nps is Similar to the Schottky Barrier Height At the Ag-AZO Interface That is a Difference between Work Function of Ag and Electron Affinity of the AZO. in Spite of An Increase in the Electron Concentration, Embedded Ag Nps Does Not Compomise the Carrier Mobility At Room Temperature. this is An Evidence Showing That this Electron Donation Mechanism by Ag Nps is Different from Impurity-Doping, Which Produces Both Electrons and Ionized Scattering Centers. Instead, An Increase in the Fermi Energy Level of the AZO Matrix Partially Neutralizes Al Impurities and the Carrier Mobility of Ag NP Embedded AZO Film is Slightly Increased. the Optical Transmittance of Mixture Films With the Resistivity Less Than 1 × 10-3 ??Cm Still Maintains Above 85\% in Visible Wavelengths. this Opens a New Paradigm to the Design of Alternative TCO Composite Materials Which Circumvent An Inherent Problem of the Impurity Doping.},
